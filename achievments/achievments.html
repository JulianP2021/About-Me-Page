			<h1>Achievements</h1>

			<p>
				Throughout my studies and career, I have had the opportunity to work on
				a variety of projects that showcase my skills and interests. Here are a
				few of my notable achievements:

						<h2>Mensch Ärgere Dich Nicht-Multiplayer</h2>
						<p>
							As a hobby, I developed a multiplayer version of the classic board
							game "Mensch Ärgere Dich Nicht" (Ludo), as well as an AI opponent
							to play against. The game was built using HTML, CSS, and
							JavaScript and was hosted on a server for online play.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to the decision-making algorithm, I also had to
							consider how the AI would interact with the game's user interface.
							I implemented features such as automatic dice rolling and
							automatic piece movement to allow the AI to play the game
							seamlessly alongside human players.

						<h2>Mensch Ärgere Dich Nicht-AI</h2>
						<p>
							One of the challenges of creating the AI for this game was
							developing a decision-making algorithm that would allow the AI to
							make strategic moves based on the current game state. I
							implemented a system that would reward the player for the best
							moves after playing a game and punish if it played aa bad move.

					<!--<div class="swiper-slide">
						<h2>Tower Defense Game</h2>
						<p>
							I also developed a tower defense game as a side project. The game
							was built in the canvas and even had an AI(Deep Q-Learning) that
							would predict the Towers needed to win that round.
						</p>

					<div class="swiper-slide">
						<h2>Car Game AI</h2>
						<p>
							One of the challenges in creating an Ai for a car game is that the
							AI needs to get to know its environment. I gave it a raycasting
							system that would send out rays like a bat and get the distance to
							a wall. Then I would get the best AI of each generation and do a
							bit of crossover and mutation(like in the NEAT genertic algorythm)
							to develop it and repeat the process.
