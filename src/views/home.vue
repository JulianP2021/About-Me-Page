            <p>
                Hi, my name is Julian Scharf and I am a Programmer. I have a passion for
                Web Development. I am also a skilled
                programmer, with experience in languages such as Typescript, JavaScript, and Java.
                I mostly worked with the frameworks Vue.
                Every project here is a personal project that I have worked on, and I am
                proud to showcase my skills and creativity through these projects.
