            Hi, my name is Julian Scharf and I am a Programmer. I have a passion for
            Web Development. I am also a skilled
            programmer, with experience in languages such as Typescript, JavaScript, and Java.
            I mostly worked with the frameworks Vue.
            Every project here is a personal project that I have worked on, and I am
            proud to showcase my skills and creativity through these projects.
