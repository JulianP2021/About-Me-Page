			<p>
				Hi, my name is Julian Scharf and I am a Programmer. I have a passion for
				Web Development and the inbuilt Tensorflow library. I am also a skilled
				programmer, with experience in languages such as Javascript(/Typescript), and Java.
			</p>

			<p>
				I will finish my general degree called "Abitur" from the
				"Gegor-Mendel-Gymnasium" this year 
			</p>
			<p>
				In my free time, I enjoy mountainbiking, programming, and playing
				soccer. My dream destination is America working in the Cloudflare
				department in California.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am currently a high school senior and I am planning to study computer
				science in college. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a
				programmer, and I hope to one day make a positive impact in the tech
				industry.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you for visiting my website. Please feel free to <button onclick="goToNextPage()">contact me</button> if you
