			<h1>Achievements</h1>

			<p>
				Throughout my studies and career, I have had the opportunity to work on
				a variety of projects that showcase my skills and interests. Here are a
				few of my notable achievements:
			</p>

			<h2>Mensch Ärgere Dich Nicht-Multiplayer</h2>
			<p>
				As a hobby, I developed a multiplayer version of the classic board game
				"Mensch Ärgere Dich Nicht" (Ludo), as well as an AI opponent to play
				against. The game was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and was
				hosted on a server for online play.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to the decision-making algorithm, I also had to consider how
				the AI would interact with the game's user interface. I implemented
				features such as automatic dice rolling and automatic piece movement to
				allow the AI to play the game seamlessly alongside human players.

			<h2>Mensch Ärgere Dich Nicht-AI</h2>
			<p>
				One of the challenges of creating the AI for this game was developing a
				decision-making algorithm that would allow the AI to make strategic
				moves based on the current game state. I implemented a minimax algorithm
				with alpha-beta pruning to enable the AI to evaluate its potential moves
				and choose the one that would maximize its chances of winning.
			</p>

			<h2>Tower Defense Game</h2>
			<p>
				I also developed a tower defense game as a side project. The game was
				built using the Unity game engine and featured custom 3D models and
				animations.

				skillset. If you have a project that you think I might be interested in,
